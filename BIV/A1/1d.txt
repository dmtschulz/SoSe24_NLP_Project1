Explanation for 1a):
From the mean vectors for female/male students we can conclude that on average, female weight (56.8 kg) and height (164.7 cm) is lower than the male weight (75.8 kg) and height (178.0 cm).

Explanation for 1b):
The covariance values represent the strength and direction of the linear relationship between weight and height.
From the covariance matrix for female students we can derive that the variability (variance) for the weight is 47 and the variability (variance) for the height is 32. The covariance between weight and height is 19.9 which indicates a positive relationship between these two variables.

From the covariance matrix for male students we can derive that the variance for the weight is high (141.3) compared to this value for female group and the variance for the height is 41.48. As for females we see a positive relationship between weight and height because the covariance between weight and height is 41.3.

Explanation for 1c):
For female and male students we see a positive correlation of 0.51 and 0.53 respectively between weight and height.
For male students the standard deviation of weight is 11.8903 which is much higher then the standard deviation for weight for female students (6.8). It means that the range and variability of body weights among male students is higher compared to female students. It could be due some outliers in the dataset. The standard deviation for height, for both student groups is similar and are roughly the same, 5.6 for females and 6.4 for males.
